# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Project 1

## Project Description
In this first part of the project, only food dots, capsules and Pacman are in the maze. Your task is to design an intelligent agent based on search algorithms (see Lecture 2) for maximizing the score. You are asked to implement the breadth-first search (BSF) and A* algorithms. We recommend to implement them in this order. It is mandatory to use only the API to retrieve game information.

## How to Use the Project
For example, you can test the DFS algorithm using the following commands:
```bash
python run.py --agent dfs --layout medium
```
